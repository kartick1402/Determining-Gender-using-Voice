# Determining-Gender-using-Voice

This is a Gender Detection model using Voice.

The files in the repository need to be downloaded as it is for execution without any changes in the directory. The two folders could not be uploaded on GitHub due to larger sizes so are attached here as a drive link. [LINK](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pUdDLV2AA890tR_k79G3qzrDQXHpgilS?usp=drive_link)

Download the two folders in the drive as it is and keep the 2 files along with the others in the same directory.

## To simply run this model:
1. Clone this repository
2. Run the [Final_GUI.py](https://github.com/kartick1402/Determining-Gender-using-Voice/blob/main/Final_GUI.py) file
3. Choose the option to either upload a voice or record a voice
4. Once tapped on Recording, start speaking as soon as the message prompts and avoid taking breaks while speaking, as small silence for a while terminates the audio recording
5. If tapped on Upload and chosen a file, wait patiently because the code might hang or lag a bit due to High Complexities. Please wait patiently for it to execute
6. View Results

##  A video is attached below showcasing the proper usage of the model
